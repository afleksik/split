# -PROJECT SPLIT- #

# *Overview*

The repository is a collection of files implemented in C. The implementations are made in order to learn how to work with files. This is a simple implementation of splitting a file into multiple parts, you can find more than one implementation for the same objective but using different algorithm strategies and optimizations.

# *Features*

    The repository provides implementations of splitinng file in one of the most fundamental general purpose languages - C.
    Well documented source code with detailed explanations provide a valuable resource for educators and students alike.
    Each source code is atomic using standard C library libc and no external libraries are required for their compilation and execution. Thus the fundamentals of the algorithms can be studied in much depth.
